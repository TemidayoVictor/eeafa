                        Although Nigerian government has made efforts to improve its education system, there are still <span class="col-blue">significant challenges that hinder equal access to education across the country</span>. Children from low-income families often <span class="col-yellow">struggle to afford school fees, uniforms, textbooks, and other educational materials.</span>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        This economic barrier exacerbates educational disparities and perpetuates cycles of poverty. Addressing regional disparities, gender inequality, socioeconomic barriers, and the impact of conflict, Nigeria can work towards <span class="col-blue">providing quality education opportunities for every child</span>, thus fostering social and economic development in the country

                        The importance of education in fostering economic growth cannot be overemphasized. Preparing individuals with key skills, knowledge, and abilities supports societies' growth and progress. Countries can enhance their human capital by providing quality education. <span class="col-yellow">A well-educated workforce is crucial for innovation, productivity, and economic competitiveness</span>
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Individuals who have received education are <span class="col-blue">more likely to find employment that pays well</span>, resulting in higher income levels and an improved quality of life for themselves and their families. Education is <span class="col-yellow">crucial in developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and technical skills</span>.

                        Growing up in a large family with a low-income parent, I understand the struggle of making ends meet. Gaining university admission was a significant challenge for my parents, who had little or no money to support my education, and for one of my older brothers, who also gained admission the same year as me. I could recall traveling from one relative to another, asking for support. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="mobile left">
                        <img src="{{ asset('images/President2.jpeg') }}" alt="">

                    <p>
                        Fortunately, with the support of my maternal uncle and other older brothers, who had begun hustling to help my parent, I could attain a university education. After graduating from the university, my dream of furthering my education abroad seemed out of reach due to financial constraints. But, through God's divine intervention with the U.S.A visa lottery, I found myself in the United States.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My journey in the U.S. was a mix of challenges and victories, but with determination, I persevered. I pursued multiple degrees and certifications (B.S. in Biology, BS in Nursing, MSc in Adult Nursing, Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner, and DNP in Adult-Gerontology Primary Care).

                    <p>
                        As I reflect on the grace of God and the support of my family for my accomplishments, I think of other families who are currently in the same position as my family was. I am now dedicated to supporting those less fortunate through Equal Education Access for All (EEAFA) in Nsukka local government and hope to expand with time.
